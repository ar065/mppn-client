    This entire client is not implemented yet.
    It is unknown when it will be finished but I really hope to finish this project.
    Everything is supposed to be seperate.
    This allows for better configuration and management of the project.
    Some things are completely modular, allowing them to be completely reworked without having to worry about much of anything else.
    This allows for better a better developer exerpience. 
    
    I really am putting effort into this project. If you don't agree with some of the things I have done then please do the following:
        1. Constructive critisism - I have put a lot of work into this project, and for people to just tell me everything I've done wrong in a way that isn't productive is very demotivating.
        2. Inform me on how i can fix/improve things - This is very helpful as I would like to fix and improve things, and this would allow me to not make these "mistakes" in the future.

    Thank you for taking the time to read this message - if you even have the chance to see it.
